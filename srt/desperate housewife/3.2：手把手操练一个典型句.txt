绝望主妇英语第二弹
主在对面的老太太一直没出来拿包裹
linnet有点担心了
接下来是冷奈跟老公汤姆的对话
我们只听两句
重点练习
听和说
i'm sure
she's fine
she never leaves her male
sitting out there
she never leaves her male
sitting out there
she never leaves her male sitting out there
这句比较简单
这个set it的用法值得学习
英语不光人能set东西
也经常set it
下一句就难了
仔细听
i mean
how many times does she thrown hours away
because we didn't pick it up the second it came
i mean
how many times does she thrown hours away
because we didn't pick it up the second it came
i mean
how many times as she thrown hours away
because we didn't pick it up the second ca
听懂了吗
没听清的
我们再来一遍
慢速版
i mean
how many times is she thrown hours away
because we didn't pick it up the second
mca
i mean
how many times does she thrown hours away
because we didn't pick it up the second
这句话显然没有什么高难度的词汇
听不清的地方主要是连读
第一处这个击穿连读times和h h被击穿了
没有发音
连成了times as
但是末尾这个词也没有存在感了
因为后面又来了个she
整个就变成了
how many times
the sh
how many times is she
how many times is she
times is
she is
she is she
how many times is she thrown hours away
接下来这个thrown hours away就很清楚了
如果这里没听出来
那就不是耳朵的问题了
是对词汇和表达不够熟悉
尤其是对这个hours的省略用法
相信会有人第一时间反应不过来
英语既会上下文重复用词
前面提到过没有了
这里就不再说or male
而是用hours来代替
how many times is she thrown hours away
because we didn't pick it up the second it came
这个后半句呢也没有词汇的难度
甚至语速和连读也不是很严重
中间还有很多停顿
because we didn't pick it up the second it came
大体上分成了三四段
是有节奏的
没有一连串的糊在一起
像这种句子呢
如果你刚才听力的时候觉得很难
那最好的解决办法就是你也学着像他一样去说
他是怎么连读的
是怎么分节奏的
你就像学唱歌一样去模仿
模仿到位了
有了肌肉记忆以后
再听到类似的
你的肌肉记忆就会自动的帮你听懂
所以下面呢我们就直接来个随堂练习
把这段分成三种速度的素材
由慢到快
大家一起练习一下跟读
how many times is she thrown hours away
because we didn't pick it up second it can
how many times did she thrown hours away
because we didn't pick it up second n
how many times does she throw hours away
because we didn't pick it up the second a game
how many times does she throw hours away
because we didn't pick it up second mi
how many times does she thrown hours away
because we didn't pick it up the second it came
how many times does she thrown hours away
because we didn't pick it up the second it ca好了
练习完毕没练到位的同学呢
可以自己倒回去多练练
接下来还有对话
我们就不继续看了
把重点聚焦在这个句子上面
尤其是跟读
建议听这句觉得费劲的
尤其是压根听不懂的同学
多练练跟读
直到能不看原文
跟着原声一起说下来
肌肉记忆呢就初步的形成了这样的练习
做多了
你会发现要比你硬着头皮干听大量的英语素材
效果好n倍
i mean
how many times does she thrown hours away
because we didn't pick it up the second
it came that would be five
