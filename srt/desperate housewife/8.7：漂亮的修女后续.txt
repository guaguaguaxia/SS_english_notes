绝望主妇英语宝藏第七代
what is your problem
sister mary will you
excuse us
please certainly
上一期我们看到了修女mary的出场
令gabby感到了巨大的威胁
后来危机进一步升级
gabby直接追杀到教堂来了
这次我们先换个学习方式
第一句我们先看看台词的中文
自己想想英文该怎么说
然后我们再对比剧里面的台词
第一句
卡洛斯问道
你把我们的婚姻紧张归咎于玛丽修女
提示一下婚姻的紧张是the tension in our marriage
the tension in our marriage
现在想想这句话应该怎么说呢
需要的话可以暂停视频
想想
ok我们看他怎么说的
your blaming sister marry for the tension in our marriage
your blaming sister mary for the tension in our marriage
典型实用的blame
someone for something
把某事归咎于某人
它的顺序还可以颠倒说
someone is to blame
就是这事应该怪某人
when no one is to play
everyone is to play
接下来我们再看看gabby怎么回应
she wants us fighting
she wants you to get tired of me and walk out
so she can have you all to herself
she wants us fighting
she wants you to get tired of me and walk out
she can have you all to herself
that's crazy
she's a nu
他这个说法不是捏造的
前面有一段修女私下里面确实说了这样的话
但是carlos不知道
所以他不相信心里是这样的人
that's crazy
she's a n
对我们来说呢
这句话值得学习的是几个实用的表达
尤其是据为己有这个结构
she wants you to get tired of me and walk out
so she can have you all to herself
so she can have you all to herself
so she can have you all to herself
that's crazy
she's a nu
she may wear a habit
and the beads
but at the end of the day
she is still a woman
just like me
and i know what i'm capable of
it's been at the end of the day
she is still a woman
just like me
and i know what i'm capable of这个at the end of the day
一天结束的时候经常用来做比喻
就像gabby说的这个意思
相当于最终到头来
归根结底
我们再补充两个悲剧
一个是园艺
一个是寓意
i'll be back at the end of the day
i thought i'm gonna fight side by side forever
but at the end of the day
or you
and i mean
最后这个名词性从句
what i'm capable of也很常用
you have no idea
what i'm capable of you have no idea
what i'm capable of you know tor
you know what they're capable of she
may wear a habit
and the beads
but at the end of the day
she is still a woman
just like me
and i know what i'm capable of
she is a woman
but she is nothing like you
