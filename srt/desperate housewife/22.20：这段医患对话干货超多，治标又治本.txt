大家好
今天我们学习一段不易跟心理医生的对话
里面实用又地道的表达非常集中
既有单个的单词短语
又有组合的套装组件
还有很多启发我们学习方法和观念的地方
是很难得的素材
对话的背景是不主动来到这家机构寻求帮助
因为他最近刚跟两个孩子
接连发生了严重的冲突
搞得他几乎精神崩溃了
things were falling apart at home
and i just i just needed a place to rest
that's all
这就是他在解释自己来这里的原因
我们先看看他用的时态
家庭快要崩溃了
我需要一个地方休息
这两个情况似乎现在也仍然成立
他仍然面临这个局面
有这个需求对吧
那么是不是也可以用现在时呢
那像类似这样的问题
我时不时的就会遇到有同学来问
这个背后是有一个很重要的思维启发的
简单说这个问题不应该是可不可以的问题
不应该从这个角度想
应该从需要需求的角度来想
我以前有一个时空思维的视频
相信很多同学看过里面分析过
老外脑子里面的时态是什么样的
像今天这个情境呢
他要解释自己为什么来这里的时候
等思绪就会穿越到之前的那个时间框架里面
因为他来这里的原因
初中出发点
都是在过去的那个时间框架里面产生的
而在那个时间框架里的动词呢没有need
也没有are
只有needed和were
或者其他的像was did这样的
属于那个过去时间框架里面的动词形式
而我们呢因为没有时空框架的观念
和时态思维的习惯
我们用词都是先想到原型need
然后再考虑是不是应该加个d
或者压根就想不到这个第二步
而对于老外来说呢
一想到要表达我来这里的原因出发点
她的思绪
首先就会穿越回自己做这个决定的那个时候
那个时空
然后再遣词造句
我们总说英语思维到底什么是英语思维
其实就是换位思考
换到英美人的角度
换到英语使用者
而不是阅读者
旁观者的角度去思考
也就是从表达需要出发去理解英语
这就是英语思维
具体到时态这件事
我们要做的就是尽量从表达需要出发
训练自己
先把思维思绪落到动作发生的那个
时间框架里面
当然这个思维训练不容易
但是他就跟游泳骑车或者开车打转向灯一样
只要养成了就自动化了
终生受用
好食材
我们就说到这儿
这句里面还有非常重要的必备级别的短语动词
for all apart
崩溃破碎
土崩瓦解
日常英语用它用的特别多
因为它非常形象
apart是分开的
再加上for一个倒塌加破碎的画面就跃然纸上了
而且他跟咱们中文的崩溃一样
既可以用于食物
也可以用于说社会组织家庭的崩溃
就像今天这个例子
另外同样也可以用于人的精神崩溃
我们再补充几个例子
让大家多增加几个记忆点
well that my life is about to fall apart
i am the ceo
if i do that the whole place will fall apart
and if you don't you'll fall apart
things were falling apart at home
and i just i just needed a place to rest
that's all
i think there's more to it than ui
think
there's more to it than nui
think there's more to it than nu
there's more to it than that
这个我去年曾经分享过一组例句
是说事情没那么简单
背后还有隐情的常用的表达
那组例句不长
我们就直接插进来
看过的同学也可以复习一波
but here there must be more to life than this the big world
you know there is more to life than just minnesota
did you ever think that
maybe there's more to life than being
really
really
really ridiculously
good looking
what happened to your brother wasn't an accident
there's more to it than that
there was more to it than that
i want you to come to dennis tomorrow
i ah sadly
there's more to it than that
i think there's more to it than that do you
i think it has to do with your kids
i think it has to do with your kids
i think it has to do with your kids
have to do with
又是一个超级高频的实用词组
按词典的释义呢
have to do with something
就等于be about something
关于什么的这种词呢
往往是我们中国学生容易忽视的
因为我们会be about
觉得会这个就行了
走遍天下
实际上是这样吗
不一定
既然be about这么好
为什么老外还用这个have to do with呢
还这么嗦
说明它还是不完全一样的
一般来说呢
同一个意思越长的词
字数越多的表达
往往越能起到更强或者更明显的强调的作用
就像心理医生的一句话说
i think it's about your kids的对比
i think it has to do with your kids
就能感受到后者的话更重
那么一点点
为什么要重呢
因为这样多多少少可以起到类似
夺过话语权的那种效果
我说的更重
我的话题就成为主题了
do you i think it has to do with your kids
事实上如果想要力度再重一些
还可以再加个
相信大家也遇到过
have something to do with something
who
the helldana hunts
the mystery bird
i figure dana has something to do with what mary
alice was trying to hide
i know he had something to do with this
i just know those two have something to do with that dead body
这个表达实际上也是一套很有用的造句组件
比如说这个something如果要变成问句
把它提到前面
变成what就成了when有什么关系的实用句式
gabby
what does she have to do with this
please stay your name and age
my age
what's my age have to do with it
what does my age have to do with it
而有些最常用的固定句子
我们整个背下来都可以直接整个拿出来用
比如这跟我有什么关系
这跟你有什么关系
does that have to do with you
what does that have to do with me
what does that have to do with me
what does that have to do with me
还有一个固定句式
把后面接的变成anything
during your separation from your husband
did you have a relationship with mr williams
what does that have to do with anything
anything是任何事
所以这句话就相当于咱们北方的俗语
这都哪儿跟哪儿
wait a minute
what was the last time
you kiss mitch
what does that have to do with anything
ok这局没有别的了
我们继续看
i think it has to do with your kids
you don't want to talk about them
what is that
probably
because i'm ashamed
ashamed
ashamed
形容词感到羞愧
羞耻的be ashamed
后面再加上个of就可以表达以某人某事为耻
just admit it you ashamed of me
you should be ashamed of yourself
what you are ashamed of being mexican
that's insane
no
no
you have nothing to be ashamed of
这个感到也可以用feel意思一样
i feel ashamed
然后我们再展开一点
前面都是说一个人感到羞耻
感到丢人
那如果说别人可耻或者他的行为可耻
怎么说呢
这个时候就要用到另一个形容词了
因为角度变了
得换成shameful
person on
hot
you are shameful
what shameful is
how much you're paying him
ashamed
my children were my life
they were the reason that i got up in the morning
they were the reason that i got up in the morning
so to have failed them as a parent
so to have failed them as a parent
so to have failed them as a parent
do you think you failed them as a parent
well
这段的时态跟刚才那句是一样的
这个feel that my suparent
刚好咱们上上节课也不例句
只是上次那个fail是不及物的用法
i have failed as a parent
这回是及物的
fail someone就是辜负某人注意
这次的时态同样也是完成时
只是这次是装在了一个不定式里面
这个不定式看样子是做整个句子的主语的
只是话没有说完
后面他要说的意思也不难猜
比如说to have fail them as a parent
makes me feel ashamed
或者to have failed them as a parent is just unacceptable
so to have failed them as a parent
do you think you failed them as a parent
well
my son is a socioppath
and my daughter hates me enough to have run away from home
i'm certainly not going to get mother of the year anytime
soon well
my son is a socioppath
and my daughter hates me enough to have run away from home
i'm certainly not going to get mother of the year anytime
soon
这个social pass有时候也被称作psycho pass
这俩作为医疗术语原本应该是中性的
但是用在日常生活里面的基本上都不是好词了
都是对心理扭曲的人的贬称
now for just one night
you try to be responsible
i like you better when you are a psycho pass
然后这个to help run away
跟前面的to have failed them一样
也是装在不定式里面的
完成时连续出现了两次
可以很好的提醒我们to后面不要只习惯接do
需要的时候也要学会用to have done
就像这两个例子
如果换成to fail to run
就表现不出这个已经发生了
已经是过去的事
已经是既成事实了
tell grace
how happy
you are to found her
to found her to found her and how much you love her
最后这句话是老外很喜欢用的一种修辞
算是反话吧
以我这样的业绩
短期内是不可能被评为年度好妈了
这个句子结构有兴趣的同学可以整个记下来
模仿造句
不论是口语作文
用一下应该都挺出彩的
包括后面的anytime
soon
也非常实用
因为我们说短期内一般更容易想到的是
in a short time
in the near future
但当你要用否定句说某事短期内做不到
不会发生
用这个anytime soon就可能会更到位
wow
that's right out about us
boing
i'm not gonna be able to do that anytime
soon
oh just because two people are engaged
doesn't mean they have to get married anytime
soon
好了这段话我们就学到这儿
今天内容有点多
就不做总结了
尤其一些关于学习方法理念的东西
一两句话也总结不了
还是希望大家多翻回去看看
多复习吧
那今天就到这
我们下节课再见
