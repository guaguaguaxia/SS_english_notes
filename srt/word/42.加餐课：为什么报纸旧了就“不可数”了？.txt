为什么报纸救了就不可数了
I'm out of newspaper
When you wrap this in newspaper in newspaper
而新报纸都是可数的
I could have my stories published in a newspaper
Right now
Published in a newspaper
In a newspaper
Newspaper in newspaper
In a newspaper
Right now
这是因为新报纸是出版物
是按期按份的
I left at nine
Thirty
You got a cup of coffee newspaper
It's a newspaper a movie
而旧报纸往往是用在其他地方
主要是包东西
那它就不再被看作是出版物了
而是被看作原材料类的名词
就像我以前讲过的石头的例子
自然状态是一块块一粒粒的
等做成石像地板砖以后
里面的原材料石头就不是一个个的了
就不可数了
除非像狮子鹿
感官上仍然是一颗颗石头
那就还可以看作是可数的stones
把旧报纸用来包东西的时候也一样
不再按期按份数了
也没法这样数了
跟普通包装纸一样
只是原材料了
也就跟paper一样不可数了
In fifty nine
I did infant was found
Wrapped in newspaper in the basement
Wrapped in newspaper in the basement
所以如果是一份完整的旧报纸
你用来读的
但它还是可数的
因为实际不是看新旧
而是看你当它是出版物还是原材料
Have you not been reading the newspapers
Have you not been reading the newspapers
Yes
I read the newspapers
What if we have to go to the bathroom
We'll lay out some newspaper for you
We'll lay out some newspaper for you
We'll lay out some newspaper for you
